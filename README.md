# mispLLMsGalaxy
A galaxy of opensource LLMs

## Description

The goal is to create a JSON file that contains every opensource LLMs and their specificities such as their score or their architecture with the MISP galaxy format.
I could not be more precise about the descriptions of the models being given the size of the files and the number of different models. Thatâ€™s why, my description includes the different tags used to qualify the models.
I had some issues regarding the scraping of the site https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard since all the data is loaded dynamically and I have not succeeded in getting access to the api to make my own requests. That is why I use the scrape-open-llm-leaderboard tool.

## How to use:

1. Clone the project:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/MacAaronGlacey/mispLLMsGalaxy.git
    ```

2. Go to the project directory:

    ```
    cd mispLLMsGalaxy
    ```

3. Use this project in order get a JSON file that contains every public model from https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard:

    [scrape-open-llm-leaderboard](https://github.com/Weyaxi/scrape-open-llm-leaderboard)

    Do not forget to specify the JSON format for good to get a JSON file and not a csv file. 

4. Put the JSON into the mispLLMsGalaxy directory and execute `getTags.py` to get the tags related to every models.

    ```
    python getTags.py
    ```

    It will create a new JSON named "updated_models.json" which contains the Tags related to each model, if the page is not available, it will delete the model from the file.

5. Use `clustering.py` to get the cluster format.

    ```
    python clustering.py
    ```

    Congratulations, if everything was done correctly, you should find the cluster in the directory "clusters". At each use the cluster file is replaced.
